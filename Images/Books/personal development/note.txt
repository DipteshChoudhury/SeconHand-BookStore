fear not be strong :-
author :- swami vivekanada
Strength and fearlessness are the two prime virtues which are the markers of  the health of a human being and society. Every crime and  and antisocial and inhuman act is
 the outcome of lack of true strength and fearlessness. But what do we mean by strength, and what does fearlessness connote? 
 In this booklet published by Advaita Ashrama, a publication branch of Ramakrishna Math, Belur Math, Swami Tathagatananda has presented Vivekananda’s views on this subject.
 We are sure the author's presentation will shed new light on our understanding of these eternal virtues and will urge our younger generation to imbibe and practice them
